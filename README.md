3. Magician Chassis from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/10825)
4. Pololu [Infrared Sensor](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pololu-carrier-with-sharp-gp2y0d805z0f-digital-distance-sensor-5cm?variant=31546927841363&currency=GBP&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=google+shopping?utm_source=google&utm_medium=surfaces&utm_campaign=shopping&gclid=CjwKCAiAm-2BBhANEiwAe7eyFO7bK1mOrWGd_Cqj9JogPAQnLsCPM71dlVHjZsbjda6yJfE5k2bLcRoCz2UQAvD_BwE)
5. A breadboard
6. Wires

## Building the Magician Chassis
You should received 14 parts to assemble the Magician Chassis. Follow these [instructions](http://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Robotics/MagicianChassisInst.pdf) to build your magician chassis. Once you have completed the chassis, attach the **Arduino Motor Shield** on to the **Arduino Uno**.
